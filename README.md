Lab Experiments: PART A

Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.
Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.
Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.
Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.
Implement and study the performance of GSM on NS2/NS3 (Using MAC layer) or equivalent environment.
Implement and study the performance of CDMA on NS2/NS3 (Using stack called Call net) or equivalent environment.
PART B Implement the following in Java:

Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).
Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.
Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.
Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client side, typed at the server side.
Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.
Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm.
